// We essentially create a schema, using the Schema constructor we imported from Mongoose, and define the fields with specific data types.
// We don't have to define the fields, as MongoDB will allow the data anyway, but for for clarity and usability, we should regulate what the data will look like.

         // uses the function dateFormat from the dateFormat.js file to format the date
         // With this get option in place, every time we retrieve a pizza, the value in the createdAt field will be formatted by the dateFormat() function and used instead of the default timestamp value. 
         // This way, we can use the timestamp value for storage, but use a prettier version of it for display.

         {

            ref: 'Comment'
         }
      ]
      // The ref property is especially important because it tells the Pizza model which documents to search to find the right comments

);
// See how we don't have to use special imported data types for the type definitions? Using MongoDB and Mongoose, we simply instruct the schema that this data will adhere to the built-in JavaScript data types, including strings, Booleans, numbers, and so on.
// Notice the empty brackets [] in the toppings field. This indicates an array as the data type. You could also specify Array in place of the brackets.

// use a virtual
// a virtual is a property that is not stored in MongoDB. Virtuals are typically used for computed properties on documents
// Virtual properties work just like regular functions
// get total count of comments and replies on retrieval
// PizzaSchema.virtual('commentCount').get(function() {
//    return this.comments.length;
// });
// new one to get the total count of replies and comments
PizzaSchema.virtual('commentCount').get(function() {
   return this.comments.reduce((total, comment) => total + comment.replies.length + 1, 0);
});
// Here we're using the .reduce() method to tally up the total of every comment with its replies. In its basic form, .reduce() takes two parameters, an accumulator and a currentValue. Here, the accumulator is total, and the currentValue is comment. As .reduce() walks through the array, it passes the accumulating total and the current value of comment into the function, with the return of the function revising the total for the next iteration through the array.
